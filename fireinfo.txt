In the Spreading Fire Simulation, a two dimensional grid is filled with either trees or blank ground.  

The player can choose the probability that a tree which neighbors a burning tree will catch on fire.  The player also chooses the first tree to catch fire.

By varying these parameters, the player can observe the spread of a forest fire under different conditions.
