In a stable ecosystem, the number of predators and the number of prey fluctuate, but remain relatively constant. Three factors can affect the cycling of predator and prey numbers:

1. The reproductive rate of the prey.
2. The death rate of the predator.
3. The initial ratio of predator to prey.
 
In the Predator Prey Simulation, the player manipulates these variables to determine how they affect the overall predator and prey populations.
